# Password Validation and Brute Force Time Estimation

This project is a locally hosted website that validates the strength of passwords and estimates the time required to brute force them.

## Features

- **Password Strength Validation:** Checks the complexity of the password based on length, character types, and entropy.
- **Brute Force Time Estimation:** Estimates the time it would take to crack the password using a simple algorithm.
- **Local Hosting:** Runs entirely on the user's local machine for privacy and security.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
